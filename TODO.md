- Politics doesn’t always end game when one team is alive
- Spectators shouldnt be able to fly through stuff
- Doesnt show scenarios when youre spectating
- Votes should show how many votes there are for specific one
- Replacing the oceans doesnt work
- Consider switching to paper spigot
- Make sure Vein works with lagworld and midas and cutclean and lagworld works with timber
- One of those may have spawned me really high up, I'm not sure how
- I wrote down something about gold, I dont remember what it was though.
- They also all still apply when in creative mode, not that that matters
- Randomzied drops doesnt check tool
- Cutclean doesnt give experience but it also doesnt take away so thats not a huge deal
- Triple ores gives experience when mining blocks that return ores
- Shared inventory throws exceptions that lag the server
- Make enderchest consistent between games but disabled on:
  - Flower Power
  - Lil Cheat
  - Dont waste your time
  - Triple ores
  - King Midas
- Achievements show in the nether
- On nether start put a nether portal in the middle of the map
- Make Spiderman one of the superpowers you can get, maybe combine it with jump
- Make a ghast shot be a superpower you can get like you activate it by sneaking
- Add a bigger warning on getting close to UHC wall
- Duos should pick another one if there are less than 2 players active
- Make randomized drops match with triple ores and whatnot
- Do incompatible ones that just dont select when chosen second
- Make it obvious which scenarios are new
- Material/UniversalMaterial have bugs
- Fix the not finding the world exceptions
- Keep track of stats and let players view stats easily
- I'm pretty sure shears on lucky leaves gives double apples but I dont wanna deal with that rn

Need to Test:

- Updated Bleeding Sweets (Disabled for now so isnt a huge deal)
- Weakest Link (Disabled for now so isnt a huge deal)
- PVE (Disabled for now so isnt a huge deal)
- Whether duos gives totem or works at all, for that matter

Potential New scenarios:

- Random: Pick a random scenario for the rest of the vote counts (If a scenario is picked before random, that one stays in)
- None: Everything here and below gets negated (If a scenario is picked before random, that one stays in)

  > These two could be put in the inventory, maybe as

- Ghost: You inherit the inventory of whoever you kill
- Chaos: Every mob that spawns is a random mob (Same mob for whole game)
- Chaos2: Your team randomizes every couple of minutes
- Infected: When you die a zombie spawn holding your stuff (Perhaps multiple zombies depending on how hard we want it to be)
- Everyone gets (the same) random potion effect every minute, have it only last like 5 seconds and it won’t be super strong
- Arrows are replaced with a random mob, including skeleton arrows
- Lava is replaced with water, vice versa, this one might be hard to do cuz it would have to be on world gen
- Every minute you must be standing on a specific block
- You cannot damage players with swords, only using other methods like fire or lava or wolves or monsters or tnt (Maybe bows)
- Explosive Gang: Everyone gets flint and steel with unbreaking, a stack of ant, a stack of creeper eggs, a stack of fire charges, a stack of tnt, and a stack of end crystals
- Gulag: When you die, you go to a gulag and battle 1v1
- Farmer: Amass the biggest army of animals and have them fight for you
- Sleeper agent: Beds explode when you try to sleep in them in the overworld like youre in the end/nether
- Assassin: Every player has 1 person they are trying to kill, and they are given a compass that points towards that person and that person is glowing for them.
  - This is the only person they are allowed to kill. If that person dies on their own, your compass points towards the next person in the cycle.
- Drunk: Controls are wonky (?) and you alternate between having speed, nausea, hunger, and resistence.
  - Drink any potion or water bottle to get drunker, making all potion effects stronger. If you get to 3 you "throw up" half of your inventory, an dif you get to 4 you get poisoned, and if you get to 5, you die instantly.
  - Drinking milk will make you throw up
  - Sleeping in a bed will make the drunkness go away but you will be hungover where you are constantly slow and have mining slowness.
  - You can get your drunkness back
- Buy teammates back with gold
- Buy dead players not on your team back
- Being on fire or in lava heals you, while water poisons you
- Your max health is 1 heart for the whole game.
- Juggernaut: 1 person is given diamond armor, a diamond sword, a diamond pickaxe, resistance, and double health. It is 1 v everyone else.
- Wither Rush: A wither is spawned in the middle of the map. Kill it to win.
- You can only die when the timer ends in a specific number, everyone gets a different one and theyre a secret (Or maybe theyre not)
- Everything in your inventory has knockback 100
- Sneaking makes you vanish completely
- With 2 diamonds, a gold block, 2 feathers and 4 leather you can make hermes winged sandles that let you fly for a bit, you fall after 15 seconds and you must wait 15 seconds to use them again and fall damage is NOT negated
- Leather can be turned into a cum rag which you can jerk off into to give yourself health. If you jerk off too much in succession, you hurt yourself and your cum rag gets gross
- Drugs
- All people who die in the first 10 minutes respawn with empty inventories in the center of the map
- Realism:
  - Temperature must be regulated
    - Can wear armor to keep you warm but if you wear a full set of diamond in the middle of the desert at day time then youre gonna die of heat exhaustion
    - Depends on biome and time of day
  - Hunger goes faster
  - You must drink water: Keeps temp regulated
  - Wearing heavy armor slows you down
- No stacking: Nothing in your inventory stacks
- Hurricane: It is raining and thundering (More than usual) and wind blows you around a lot
- End Start: You start in the end.
- Fish gang: You are given infinite water breathing and enchanted boots that let you swim and whatnot underwater as well as night vision, however you cannot breathe on land for longer than 10 seconds. You may bring buckets of water with you and stand in them to get oxygen
- Every player is disguised as a block (A rare block) that snaps to the grid if you stay still for 5 seconds
- Idk if its possible but Play the game as chickens (low to the ground and Other players see you as a chicken also you float down to the ground instead of falling)
- King of the hill: Everyone gets a map, Whoever has the most kills or the most hearts if its a tie is glowing on everyone's map
- You and someone else (Who you are not on a team with) have health bars swapped. But you cant just try to kill yourself because you die when they die.
