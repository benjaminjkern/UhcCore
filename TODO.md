Potential New scenarios:

- Ghost: You inherit the inventory of whoever you kill
- Chaos: Every mob that spawns is a random mob (Same mob for whole game)
- Chaos2: Your team randomizes every couple of minutes

- Everyone gets (the same) random potion effect every minute, have it only last like 5 seconds and it won’t be super strong
- Arrows are replaced with a random mob, including skeleton arrows
- Lava is replaced with water, vice versa, this one might be hard to do cuz it would have to be on world gen
- Every minute you must be standing on a specific block
- You cannot damage players with swords, only using other methods like fire or lava or wolves or monsters or tnt (Maybe bows)
- Explosive Gang: Everyone gets flint and steel with unbreaking, a stack of ant, a stack of creeper eggs, a stack of fire charges, a stack of tnt, and a stack of end crystals
- Gulag: When you die, you go to a gulag and battle 1v1
- Buy teammates back with gold
- Buy dead players not on your team back
