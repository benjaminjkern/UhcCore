Big todos:

- Get a plugin that gently reminds server to vote and post
- Advertise & Get a consistent player base
- Voting & Posting benefits
  - Vote once a day to get a double vote counts & ability to downvote for 24 hours
  - Post on MCForum to become a member (Aesthetic on the server, rank on discord)

Small changes:

- Use one of your votes to downvote
- Make the paper tell you how many votes you have left
- Politics doesn’t always end game when one team is alive
- Spectators shouldnt be able to fly through stuff
- Doesnt show scenarios when youre spectating
- Votes should show how many votes there are for specific one
- Replacing the oceans doesnt work
- Consider switching to paper spigot
- Make sure Vein works with lagworld and midas and cutclean and lagworld works with timber
- I wrote down something about gold, I dont remember what it was though.
- They also all still apply when in creative mode, not that that matters
- One of those three ^ may have spawned me really high up, I'm not sure how
- Randomzied drops also does the same thing

Need to Test:

- Updated Bleeding Sweets
- Whether duos gives totem
- Whether midas, triple, and cutclean all check for the proper tool
- Skyhigh
- Weakest Link
- PVE

New scenarios:

- Random: Pick a random scenario for the rest of the vote counts (If a scenario is picked before random, that one stays in)
- None: Everything here and below gets negated (If a scenario is picked before random, that one stays in)
- Ghost: You inherit the inventory of whoever you kill
- Chaos: Every mob that spawns is a random mob (Same mob for whole game)
- Chaos2: Your team randomizes every couple of minutes
- Infected: When you die a zombie spawn holding your stuff (Perhaps multiple zombies depending on how hard we want it to be)
- Everyone gets (the same) random potion effect every minute, have it only last like 5 seconds and it won’t be super strong
- Arrows are replaced with a random mob, including skeleton arrows
- Lava is replaced with water, vice versa, this one might be hard to do cuz it would have to be on world gen
- Every minute you must be standing on a specific block
- You cannot damage players with swords, only using other methods like fire or lava or wolves or monsters or tnt (Maybe bows)
- Explosive Gang: Everyone gets flint and steel with unbreaking, a stack of ant, a stack of creeper eggs, a stack of fire charges, a stack of tnt, and a stack of end crystals
- Gulag: When you die, you go to a gulag and battle 1v1
- Buy teammates back with gold
- Buy dead players not on your team back
- Being on fire or in lava heals you

Far down the line:

- Donor Ranks (Aesthetic/More votes on which gametype or maybe multiple votes for same thing/can downvote, guranteed spot on server, trump vote (if you choose to vote once that one scenario is going in regardless))
- Upgrade Server infrastructure - this was done but can always be added to
- Easy suggestion box
- Change Lobby
- Add Bungee so they just go back to a bungee server instead of being kicked, also so that if there is a big enough player base people can choose to do duos/quads
- Make a discord
- New Banner
- A way to keep track of which scenarios are popular
- Website to tell you status of server
