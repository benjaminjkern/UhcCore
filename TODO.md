New scenarios:

- Ghost: You inherit the inventory of whoever you kill
- Chaos: Every mob that spawns is a random mob (Same mob for whole game)
- Chaos: Your team randomizes every couple of minutes
- Infected: When you die a zombie spawn holding your stuff (Perhaps multiple zombies depending on how hard we want it to be)
- Everyone gets (the same) random potion effect every minute, have it only last like 5 seconds and it won’t be super strong
- Arrows are replaced with a random mob, including skeleton arrows
- Lava is replaced with water, vice versa, this one might be hard to do cuz it would have to be on world gen
- Every minute you must be standing on a specific block
- You cannot damage players with swords, only using other methods like fire or lava or wolves or monsters or tnt (Maybe bows)
- Explosive Gang: Everyone gets flint and steel with unbreaking, a stack of ant, a stack of creeper eggs, a stack of fire charges, a stack of tnt, and a stack of end crystals
- Random: Pick a random scenario for the rest of the vote counts (If a scenario is picked before random, that one stays in)
- Gulag: When you die, you go to a gulag and battle 1v1

Far down the line:

- Donor Ranks (Aesthetic/More votes on which gametype or maybe multiple votes for same thing/can downvote)
