# Bots

> URGENT

- Bots teleport in front of players on occasion
- Bots sometimes only move one space at a time
- Bots sometimes unequip their armor

> Future features / not as important bugs

- Fix bots with curse of vanishing and binding
- Use randomized names instead of bot#
  - Need to verify that specific player doesnt join and screw it up
- Rework so that they have a general pick up item event, and later scan through their inventory for stuff they can do
  - Such as equip armor
  - Or eat gapples
  - Or drink potions
    - Only do this if potions can work
- Bots chase bats
- Allow bots to pick up, but not use, enderpearls and potions, OR figure out how to fix the code so they dont try to do that because its dumb that they can do broken things like that
- Bots should be able to pick up items and experience all the time
- Tons of "Yaw not finite" errors causing bots to not be spawned / be invisible / spawn in the center of the map, definitely has to do with skins being updated
  - Appears to not really be an issue anymore
- For some reason bots can throw enderpearls at people to make them fly up in the air
- Bots shouldn't go for neutral mobs
- Mobs don't target bots on their own
- Bots don't take fall damage
- Bots should run from mobs if their health is low
- Bots should be able to heal themselves if players can - if players have golden apples or potions or whatever
- Make bots have an AI that learns (NO IDEA HOW TO DO THIS)
  - In the future I would like to overhaul the whole thing since I kinda hate how its all set up rn
- The tablist is disabled for bots rn but it should in the future: - This might actually be doable
  - Show all bots, not just the ones that are loaded
  - Show when bots are respawned in spectator mode
  - Show the bot's teams and health
