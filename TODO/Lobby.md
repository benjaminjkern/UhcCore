# Lobby

> Bugs / Should do before next update

- Make higher rank players see different things on the scoreboards (if possible)
  - Otherwise make it so they cycle through all ranks

> New features / Less Urgent

- Contemplate getting rid of patron ranks and just doing optional donations for fun
- See if theres an undercounting of scores because the bots scores seem to always plummet
- deaths are definitely being overcounted
- Lots of lag warnings figure it out
- Make a separate notification whenever someone leaves the server from in a game
- Hide commands that players dont need to see
- Make spawn town
- Breaking blocks doesnt say anything
  - In spawn it shouldnt say anything but outside of spawn it should say "Yadaydada owns that! If you want to claim land, yadadada"
- Dying in lobby says you have no bed, it shouldnt
- Inconsistency with dying with items
- Fix all the gay stuff with griefprevention
  - Fire spread should be active in lobby
  - The "Safe items" thing is gay
  - shouldnt softmute you automatically or censor bad words
- Get rid of the how to claim land thing
  - Unurgent because I think it only shows up for members
- Players can tp to the end
- Should start you in survival mode and then put you in creative if you leave the spawn town, put you back in survival if you reenter
- Have players go back to their previous position if they are coming back from a game, but spawn at spawn if they arent
- Add spectator command npcs
- Should be able to cancel updating scenario board
- Stats should work in a database-map fashion instead of being all cached at once
- Make rating only stay if you are a member "Want your ranking to stay when you log off?"
  - Consider this since a lot of people arent members
- Add info around spawn on:
  - What YEUH is
  - What being a member does
  - What being a patron does
- Make boats float in lava
- Make stats from console show stats a bit clearer
- Add bit to the help menu for:
  - Actually explain the server
  - Explain being a member
  - Display what commands you can use
- Make list menu show whether in-game players are alive or dead **I THINK I DID THIS**
  - Make list allow you to either see stats, tpa, or spectate a player that is in a game
  - Search for a player online command ?
- Make stats keep track of player's favorite scenarios and most played scenarios
