# Lobby

### URGENT
  
### Verify fixed

### Medium Urgency

- Make upgrading rank or level cooler or make people expect it more so they look forward to it.
- Dying in lobby says you have no bed, it shouldnt
    - Only says if you have a bed
- 1x1 claims keep getting made and I'm not sure how
- List is really slow and it slows down other players for some reason?
    - Make list menu show whether in-game players are alive or dead
    - Make list allow you to either see stats, tpa, or spectate a player that is in a game
- can use /? to see commands
- can use / and then tab to see a bunch of commands too
- Pretty sure top nemesis is broken
- Inconsistency with dying with items in lobby
- Make stats keep track of player's favorite scenarios and most played scenarios
- GIve the warning that tells player a new game is ready a happy sound!

### Low Urgency

- Make admins start in the middle and give everyone a home button
- Add ability to pvp in lobby (But not die)
    - Add a pvp on/off button
- Give admins an autostart button so it doesnt have to be a command
- Ranks have fancy shit in their nametags
- Make higher rank players see different things on the scoreboards (if possible)
    - Otherwise make it so they cycle through all ranks
- Make spawn town
- Breaking blocks doesnt say anything
    - In spawn it shouldnt say anything but outside of spawn it should say "Yadaydada owns that! If you want to claim land, yadadada"
- Should be able to cancel updating scenario board
- Make rating only stay if you are a member
    - "Want your ranking to stay when you log off?"
    - Consider this since a lot of people arent members
- Add info around spawn on:
    - What YEUH is
    - What being a member does
    - What being a patron does
- Make boats float in lava
- Add bit to the help menu for:
    - Actually explain the server
    - Explain being a member
    - Display what commands you can use
- Search for a player online command ?
