# Scenarios

### Urgent

- Timebomb doesn't include armor they are wearing (?)
- King of hill
    - Bots don't stop targeting players after they were king

### Verify fixed

- Super heros:
    - Fireballs from blazes are sourced from the player and give them credit for kill
    - Make it so hit-based powers do not work if pvp is disabled

### Medium Urgency

- Bleeding sweets seems to activate twice on gamemodes like slayer and king of the hill
- Super heros
    - If the player attacks a zombie, a tamed dog will still attack the zombie, not sure if this is fixable
        - I think I tried to turn off the targeting
    - make lucky power compatible with ez money (always cook instead of dropping ore) and triple ore (triple ore) and king midas (always drop gold)
        - Consider moving to a generalized UHCBreakBlockEvent
- Fifty
    - Should tell you in chat at beginning what team you're on
    - Make not start all in exactly the same spot
    - Make the teams differentiable
- Lag world
    - should be fully compatible with Timber(EZ Money)
- Ez money, triple ores, randomized drops, etc. all still apply when in creative mode. Across the board they shouldnt work.
- Randomzied drops:
    - Rather than blocking it can be made compatible, no reason not to
    - Doesnt check tool - not entirely sure how I feel about this
    - Should work for mob drops too - can be done with "breaking" an animal spawn egg

### Low Urgency

- Duos
    - Make partner glow and/or give both players a compass that points to them
        - Make it so if another team picks up your compass it can lead them to their teammate
- Swap
    - Make warning sounds
- Slayer
    - Make sidebar points display like in COD
- One trick pony
    - Giants are weird
- Dont waste your time (Not in anymore)
    - Crafting multiple items doesnt enchant all of them
- Fish gang (Not in anymore)
    - should give player better mining speed or aqua affinity
    - make it so respiration or water breathing help with breathing on land
    - make regaining of breath a bit faster to mimic how it really works
    - Make the death message say suffocating or something
- Politics (Not in anymore)
    - On switch dog should become docile
        - Dogs could switch collar color too on switch
        - Not entirely sure the team switching is happening as quickly as possible
    - Sidebar display biggest team
    - Need to overhaul
- ChickenFIght (I want to make this work)

### Scenarios that totally work but aren't in right now
- Nether Start
    - Need to make work better with bots and add more structures and this could be good
- 9 slots
- Random crafts
- Dont waste your time
    - Need to nerf
- Vein miner
    - Maybe combine with cutclean
    - This could also be included as an extra in a bigger scenario or as an enchantment
- Weakest Link
- Skyhigh
- Dragon rush
    - maybe put in real world
- Best PVE
    - This one was a little 
- Triple ores

# New ideas:

## Easy/Very doable ideas:

- Everything in your inventory has knockback 100
- Sneaking makes you vanish completely but also stop moving
- Fiery: Being on fire burns things in your inventory and replaces them with charcoal every second
- Nukaworld: All explosions do a ridiculous amount (x100) of damage
- Sleep in a bed to teleport somewhere random in the world
- Everyone gets (the same) random potion effect every minute, have it only last like 5 seconds and it wonâ€™t be super strong
- Arrows are replaced with a random mob, including skeleton arrows
- Explosive Gang: Everyone gets flint and steel with unbreaking, a stack of creeper eggs, a stack of fire charges, a stack of tnt
- Every minute you must be standing on a specific block
    - Add a clause so that it doesnt do like an impossible block
        - Either only do blocks that have been stepped on already or give a set list
    - THis would be hard with bots
- Being on fire or in lava heals you, while water poisons you
    - Tell bots to avoid water
- Second Start: All people who die in the first 10 minutes respawn with empty inventories in the center of the map
- Anvils drop on everyone's head every 20 seconds
- Nothing ever dies: Killing mobs just teleports them to a random player.
- Instakill: Players instant break blocks and instant kill mobs and other players with just their fists.
- Pacifism: Every time you kill something, you get knocked down to half a heart.
    - Maybe they can get some other punishment
        - Like lose entire inventory
- Whenever a player gets damage they get teleported 100 blocks up
- Yoyo:
    - PVP Randomly toggles off and on throughout the match
    - When pvp is off, all players are hidden
- Everyone starts game with 1 diamond
    - Would have to rework bot shit so that one diamond doesnt automatically mean better stuff
    - Or honestly maybe not haha
- With 2 diamonds, a gold block, 2 feathers and 4 leather you can make hermes winged sandles that let you fly for a bit, you fall after 15 seconds and you must wait 15 seconds to use them again and fall damage is NOT negated

## Medium difficulty/less fleshed out but still doable ideas:

- you cant move or jump, negated fall damage, and an infinite stack of enderpearls. teleport and win game
    - This would be monstrous with bots
- Its not about surviving its about collecting the most of a random item
   - Dont pick weird items just do like iron or diamond or emeralds or gold
   - I actually feel like if its not any of those then this one would suck
   - Super hard with bots
- Infected: When you die a zombie spawn holding your stuff (Perhaps multiple zombies depending on how hard we want it to be)
- Gulag: When you die, you go to a gulag and battle 1v1
- Assassin: Every player has 1 person they are trying to kill, and they are given a compass that points towards that person and that person is glowing for them.
    - This is the only person they are allowed to kill. If that person dies on their own, your compass points towards the next person in the cycle.
    - If you try to kill anyone else, the kill is cancelled and you die instead
- Prop hunt
- Drunk: Controls are wonky (?) and you alternate between having speed, nausea, hunger, and resistence.
    - Drink any potion or water bottle to get drunker, making all potion effects stronger. If you get to 3 you "throw up" half of your inventory, an dif you get to 4 you get poisoned, and if you get to 5, you die instantly. "You blacked out"
    - Drinking milk will make you throw up
    - Sleeping in a bed will make the drunkness go away but you will be hungover where you are constantly slow and have mining slowness.
    - You can get your drunkness back by drinking more
- Buy teammates back with gold or Buy dead players not on your team back like in solo
- Juggernaut: 1 person is given netherite armor, a netherite sword, a netherite pickaxe, resistance, and double health. It is 1 v everyone else.
- Contracts: Kill a specific player within a time frame and win a prize
- Realism:
    - Temperature must be regulated
      - Can wear armor to keep you warm but if you wear a full set of diamond in the middle of the desert at day time then youre gonna die of heat exhaustion
      - Depends on biome and time of day
    - Hunger goes faster
    - You must drink water: Keeps temp regulated
    - Wearing heavy armor slows you down
- Hurricane: It is raining and thundering (More than usual) and wind blows you around a lot
- Everyone gets a map, Whoever has the most kills or the most hearts (Or in slayer or king, whoever is winning) is glowing on everyone's map
- You and someone else (Who you are not on a team with) have health bars swapped. But you cant just try to kill yourself because you die when they die.
    - It doesn't say who it is but they are glowing for you and only you.
    - If you kill them then your health goes back to normal
- Idk if its possible but Play the game as chickens (low to the ground and Other players see you as a chicken also you float down to the ground instead of falling)
- King of the hill but with points: A crown spawns in the middle of the map and players must hold it to amass points, technically the winner would be whoever has the most points at the end
- Beheading: When you kill players, you get their head. Wear their head to disguise as that player. (Can pretend you are on someone else's team). You can also turn the head into a golden head, which is in between a god apple and a golden apple.
- UAV: All players get a map of where all the other players are
    - Or maybe just all players glow behind walls
- Hunger Games: A bunch of chests with loot spawn in the middle, and everyone spawns around the middle, and spectating players can give items to alive players
- JETPACK: HOld space to fly
- Wandering trader++: Wandering traders with sick deals spawn all over the map.
- Fart: When you sneak, you fart. Nearby players get nauseous, if they're really close or already nauseous they get poisoned. Farting also launches you in a random direciton a small amount.
- Air raid: Bombing areas are created intermittently. Tnt will be dropped from the sky in these areas.
- InfectedButDifferent: One person has the disease to start out. If everyone gets infected, the infected players win. If all infected players are killed, everyone wins.
    - Infect someone by holding right click on them for 2 seconds.
    - Ratings will likely have to be different in this gamemode
- Maybe do a mode with a prebuilt map
- Dragon tamer: Everyone gets an ender dragon that they can put into and out of an egg and they can ride
- Wither tamer: Everyone gets a wither that they can put into and out of an egga nd they can ride
- Piggyback riding: Right click another player to jump on their shoulders
- Ride anything: Ride anything (Cant always control it)
- Minion
    - Everybody gets a minion that they can command to do things
      - Harvest materials
      - Kill enemies
      - Protect me
      - Scout area
        - It will tell you in the chat when it finds someone and run awy from them if they get too close
    - THe minion has the same inventory as you
    - THe minion is a baby zombie that has your skull on
      - Perhaps also leather armor that tries to match your skin but idk how hard that would be to do
- Quicksand
    - You will slowly sink in sand
- Trusty Steed
    - Everyone has a horse that they are soul bonded with. If you and the horse are too far apart, you both start to lose health.
    - The health bars are separated, so if the horse dies you dont die instantly, but you do start to die slowly.
    - You can steal someone else's horse, and you instantly soul bond with them
    - Your horse gets stronger and faster each time you get a kill
- Wizardly Crafting
    - Everything you craft gets a random enchantment, including enchantments that can't exist on the given item
    - See if I can make custom enchantments
- Packapunch
    - A machine drops from the sky that allows you to enchant your tools to overpowered levels
    - Machines can also drop that give perks (potions) and you can pay with gold or experience
- Your team randomizes every couple of minutes
    - only works for non solo games
- End Start: You start in the end.
- Everybody's screen is flipped upside down
- Spectators can give gifts to the living
    - This wouldn't work well with gamemodes where people don't die
- COD Game modes:
    - Gun Game
    - Seek and Destroy
- Astrophobia
    - Meteors, skeletons in spacesuits that shoot rockets, charged creepers
- Snowball flight
    - Can ride snowballs when you throw them
- Time flies
    - Days are 5 minutes long (Daytime 2.5 minutes nighttime 2.5 minutes)
- Nuclear furnace
    - If a furnace goes on and then turns off, it explodes
- Sheer power
    - Can add extra materials to a weapon to enchant it with sharpness +1
    - OR maybe can add two weapons together to get sharpness + 1
- Superlava
    - Lava flows fast
- Creepers will only explode when you are looking at them
    - Also make creepers spawn more often
- Ricochet kills
    - Arrows bounce off walls
- Inventories are rotated:
    - Everytime you pick up an item, it goes into the next person's inventory
    - If they drop something, it gets dropped from your player
    - It should be one big loop so when the guy that has your inventory gets killed, it rotates around
    - You can know who is controlling your inventory
    - If the person above you dies then your inventory switches entirely
- Gluttony:
    - If your hunger is above 7 you are slowed down
- Cannot move if someone else is looking at you

## Hard/Probably not going to happen ideas:

- Voldemort: eyes in the back of your head
- You can ram someone by riding into them with a horse or pig or llama or strider
- Farmer: Amass the biggest army of animals and have them fight for you
- You will occasionally swing or place blocks or say things in the chat or drop the item in your hand and you cannot control it
- Easy mode
    - The difficulty is made into easy
    - Health regenerates normally
- Bed wars
    - Map split into teams of 4 with a bed that they have to protect
