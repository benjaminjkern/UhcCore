# Scenarios

> Broken Scenarios

- Duos

  - My partner often isnt where I am, not sure whats up

- Slayer

  - Theres a chance that this is lagging the server a shit ton
    - Could be because its going through and checking who the winner is every single second
    - regardless of if this is lagging the server

- Politics

  - On switch dog should become docile
    - Dogs could switch collar color too on switch
  - Not entirely sure the team switching is happening as quickly as possible
  - Sidebar display biggest team
  - Need to overhaul

- Super heros

  - If the player attacks a zombie, a tamed dog will still attack the zombie, not sure if this is fixable
  - make lucky power compatible with ez money (always cook instead of dropping ore) and triple ore (triple ore) and king midas (always drop gold)
  - COnsider switching the shift based powers to command items
  - Verify fireballs from blazes are sourced from the player
  - Necromancer bots can be killed by their own zombies
  - Throws errors a lot, doesnt appear to lag the server though

- Fifty

  - Make not start all in exactly the same spot
  - Make the teams differentiable

- One trick pony

  - I can make the mobs betterly invisible
    - **Verify that bows and things dont spawn anymore**

- Fish gang

  - should give player better mining speed or aqua affinity
  - make it so respiration or water breathing help with breathing
  - make regaining of breath a bit faster to mimic how it really works
  - Make the death message say suffocating or something

> Not as URGENT ideas

- Ez money, triple ores, randomized drops, etc. all still apply when in creative mode. Across the board they shouldnt work.
- Randomzied drops:
  - Doesnt check tool - not entirely sure how I feel about this
  - Should work for mob drops too
- Dont waste your time:
  - Crafting multiple items doesnt enchant all of them
- Lag world
  - should be fully compatible with Timber(EZ Money)
- Swap
  - Make warning sounds
- Hoes mad
  - Add enchantments to hoes and timer between shots

### New ideas:

1. Fiery: Being on fire burns things in your inventory and replaces them with charcoal every second
2. Voldemort: eyes in the back of your head
3. There's probably a way to make everybody have their screen flip
4. Nukaworld: All tnts do a ridiculous amount of damage
5. Sleep in a bed to teleport somewhere random in the world
6. Its not about surviving its about collecting the most of a random item
   - Dont pick weird items just do like iron or diamond or emeralds or gold
   - I actually feel like if its not any of those then this one would suck
7. You can ram someone by riding into them with a horse or pig or llama or strider
8. Your team randomizes every couple of minutes - only works for non solo games
9. Infected: When you die a zombie spawn holding your stuff (Perhaps multiple zombies depending on how hard we want it to be)
10. Everyone gets (the same) random potion effect every minute, have it only last like 5 seconds and it wonâ€™t be super strong

11. Arrows are replaced with a random mob, including skeleton arrows

12. Every minute you must be standing on a specific block

13. Explosive Gang: Everyone gets flint and steel with unbreaking, a stack of creeper eggs, a stack of fire charges, a stack of tnt

14. Gulag: When you die, you go to a gulag and battle 1v1

15. Farmer: Amass the biggest army of animals and have them fight for you

16. Assassin: Every player has 1 person they are trying to kill, and they are given a compass that points towards that person and that person is glowing for them.

    - This is the only person they are allowed to kill. If that person dies on their own, your compass points towards the next person in the cycle.
    - If you try to kill anyone else, the kill is cancelled and you die instead

17. Prop hunt

18. Drunk: Controls are wonky (?) and you alternate between having speed, nausea, hunger, and resistence.

    - Drink any potion or water bottle to get drunker, making all potion effects stronger. If you get to 3 you "throw up" half of your inventory, an dif you get to 4 you get poisoned, and if you get to 5, you die instantly. "You blacked out"
    - Drinking milk will make you throw up
    - Sleeping in a bed will make the drunkness go away but you will be hungover where you are constantly slow and have mining slowness.
    - You can get your drunkness back by drinking more

19. Buy teammates back with gold or Buy dead players not on your team back like in solo

20. Being on fire or in lava heals you, while water poisons you

21. Juggernaut: 1 person is given netherite armor, a netherite sword, a netherite pickaxe, resistance, and double health. It is 1 v everyone else.

22. Wither Rush: A wither is spawned in the middle of the map Starting at 10 minutes. Kill it to win.

23. Contracts: Kill a specific player within a time frame and win a prize

24. Everything in your inventory has knockback 100

25. Sneaking makes you vanish completely but also stop moving

26. With 2 diamonds, a gold block, 2 feathers and 4 leather you can make hermes winged sandles that let you fly for a bit, you fall after 15 seconds and you must wait 15 seconds to use them again and fall damage is NOT negated

27. Second Start: All people who die in the first 10 minutes respawn with empty inventories in the center of the map

28. Realism:

    - Temperature must be regulated
      - Can wear armor to keep you warm but if you wear a full set of diamond in the middle of the desert at day time then youre gonna die of heat exhaustion
      - Depends on biome and time of day
    - Hunger goes faster
    - You must drink water: Keeps temp regulated
    - Wearing heavy armor slows you down

29. No stacking: Nothing in your inventory stacks

30. Hurricane: It is raining and thundering (More than usual) and wind blows you around a lot

31. End Start: You start in the end.

32. Every player is disguised as a block (A rare block) that snaps to the grid if you stay still for 5 seconds

33. Idk if its possible but Play the game as chickens (low to the ground and Other players see you as a chicken also you float down to the ground instead of falling)

34. Everyone gets a map, Whoever has the most kills or the most hearts if its a tie is glowing on everyone's map

35. King of the hill: A crown spawns in the middle of the map and players must hold it to amass points, technically the winner would be whoever has the most points at the end

36. You and someone else (Who you are not on a team with) have health bars swapped. But you cant just try to kill yourself because you die when they die.

37. You will occasionally swing or place blocks or say things in the chat or drop the item in your hand and you cannot control it

38. Anvils drop on everyone's head every 20 seconds

39. you cant move or jump, negated fall damage, and an infinite stack of enderpearls. teleport and win game

40. Hunger Games: A bunch of chests with loot spawn in the middle, and everyone spawns around the middle, and spectating players can give items to alive players

41. UAV: All players get a map of where all the other players are

    - Or maybe just all players glow behind walls

42. JETPACK: HOld space to fly

43. Instakill: Players instant break blocks and instant kill mobs and other players with just their fists.

44. Nothing ever dies: Killing mobs just teleports them to a random player.

45. Wandering trader++: Wandering traders with sick deals spawn all over the map.

46. Beheading: When you kill players, you get their head. Wear their head to disguise as that player. (Can pretend you are on someone else's team). You can also turn the head into a golden head, which is in between a god apple and a golden apple.

47. Pacifism: Every time you kill something, you lose a heart.

48. Fart: When you sneak, you fart. Nearby players get nauseous, if they're really close or already nauseous they get poisoned. Farting also launches you in a random direciton a small amount.

49. Air raid: Bombing areas are created intermittently. Tnt will be dropped from the sky in these areas.

50. InfectedButDifferent: One person has the disease to start out. If everyone gets infected, the infected players win. If all infected players are killed, everyone wins.

    - Infect someone by holding right click on them for 2 seconds.

51. Maybe do a mode with a prebuilt map

54. Wither tamer: Everyone gets a wither that they can put into and out of an egga nd they can ride

55. Piggyback riding: Right click another player to jump on their shoulders

56. Ride anything: Ride anything (Cant always control it)

57. Minion

    - Everybody gets a minion that they can command to do things
      - Harvest materials
      - Kill enemies
      - Protect me
      - Scout area
        - It will tell you in the chat when it finds someone and run awy from them if they get too close
    - THe minion has the same inventory as you
    - THe minion is a baby zombie that has your skull on
      - Perhaps also leather armor that tries to match your skin but idk how hard that would be to do

58. Quicksand

    - You will slowly sink in sand

59. Easy mode

    - The difficulty is made into easy
    - Health regenerates normally

60. Trusty Steed

    - Everyone has a horse that they are soul bonded with. If you and the horse are too far apart, you both start to lose health.
