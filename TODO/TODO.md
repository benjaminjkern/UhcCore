# Server in General

### URGENT

### Verify

### Medium Urgency

- A PVP World and/or a parkour world for people to wait around in
- Work on bettering the registered servers infrastructure on the lobby side, as in always have game objects that are controlled by the lobby rather than being abstracted away and optionally connected to the lobby
- The game servers crash a lot and don't turn back on, consider adding a separate instance so that multiple servers can run simultaneously
- Implement Ranks / Patreon
- Advertise & Get a consistent player base
- Upgrade Server infrastructure - this was done but can always be added to

### Low Urgency

- Make it so it automatically tells players when i put in new scenarios
- On minecraftservers our uptime is 50%
- Make the fake player amount go up and down and be sorta random if possible
- Voting:
  - Add supply crates
  - Add double vote power
- Get an intern to help out with coding
  - They could have the ability to push and deploy the test lobby and test games
  - make test servers run on a different machine that dont lag out the main server
- A test server complete with test lobby and test game
- Multiple lobby servers - once there are more players
- A way to keep track of which scenarios are popular
- Server website
- Auction: once a week we give stuff away outside of the game and you can put in tickets
- Server-wide nicknames
- A server economy
- Automated Events via Discord
- Friend / Party system
